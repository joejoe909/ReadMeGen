## Installation

I recomend you clone this project, make sure Node.Js is installed. Run Vs Code or your enviorment. If you're used to running Vs Code locate the folder in your workspace. You may have to copy this folder to a workspace by the way. Once you do right click on the folder and selct "open in integrated terminal" run node index.js it should run. If you're using git bash navigate to the folder and do the same node index.js.

## Usage

The Aim is to faciliate readme file creation.
